                <p>Lavender Town (Japanese: シオンタウン, Hepburn: Shion Taun, Shion Town) is a fictional village in the
                    Pokémon
                    Red and Blue video games. Stylized as a haunted location, Lavender Town is home to the Pokémon
                    Tower, a
                    burial ground for deceased Pokémon and a location to find Ghost-Type Pokémon. The background music
                    of
                    Lavender Town is renowned for adding to the town's creepy atmosphere and in 2010, it gave rise to
                    the
                    'Lavender Town Syndrome' creepypasta, which suggests that more than <a class="linkarticle"

                        3,400 Japanese children</a>
                    committed
                    suicide
                    after listening to the track from the Japanese Green version.</p>

                <h2 class="title2">In the Games</h2>
                <p>Lavender Town is a village that can be visited in Pokémon Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, and sequels Gold,
                    Silver, Crystal, and the remakes thereof. A departure from the typical joyous tone of Red, Green,
                    Blue, and Yellow, it is home to the "Pokémon Tower", a graveyard filled with mourning trainers and
                    hundreds of tombstones for deceased Pokémon.There the player character can come across the
                    ghost-type Pokémon Gastly and Haunter. The tower is the only place where they are available for
                    capture. During the story of Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow, the player will utilise the item Silph
                    Scope to deal with the ghost-type Pokémon. It is implied that the village is haunted by the spirit
                    of dead Pokémon, in particular a Marowak, murdered by Team Rocket, searching for its
                    orphaned-Cubone. This story is expanded on in the remake Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go,
                    Eevee! Lavender Town is the player's first encounter with the concept of Pokémon dying. It's one of
                    a few towns in Kanto not to feature a gym.

                    The Pokémon Tower was replaced by the "Kanto Radio Tower" in Pokémon Gold and Silver. Lavender Town
                    is also home to the "Name Rater", which allows players to change the nickname of their Pokémon, and
                    a care home for abandoned Pokémon.

                    The Pokémon Tower appears in the episode "The Tower of Terror", the 23rd episode from the first
                    season of the Pokémon anime series, when Ash, Misty, and Brock search for ghost-type Pokémon for the
                    gym battle against Sabrina. Lavender Town also appears in the Pokémon Adventures and The Electric
                    Tale of Pikachu manga series. In the former, it is explicitly home to the graves of many Pokémon.

                    The Pokémon Tower is also the main setting of the second episode in Pokémon Origins, in which the
                    story of the orphaned Cubone is shown.</p>

                <h2 class="title2">The Soundtrack</h2>
                <p>The chiptune background music of Lavender Town in Pokémon Red, Blue, Green and Yellow versions has
                    garnered much interest due to some listeners finding it unsettling. Listing it as the second-most
                    scary video game track in 2012, Brittany Vincent of Bloody Disgusting stated that Lavender Town's
                    "deceptively calm ... tune ranks highly on most gamers' lists of terrifying childhood memories."
                    Lavender Town's music, composed by <a class="linkarticle"
                        href="https://www.instagram.com/pokemon_masuda/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="external">Junichi
                        Masuda</a>, is deliberately atonal and combines sharp
                    chiptune sounds with "a cavalcade of jarring chords" to create an eerie atmosphere. </p>

                    Parijat of GamingBolt included the song on their list of creepy soundtracks in non-horror games. Jay
                    Hathaway of Gawker stated that leaving the music on loop may cause a "vague sense of dread". Kevin
                    Knezevic of GameSpot called it "one of the area's most unforgettable features".
                    In Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal versions (and in their remakes Pokémon HeartGold and
                    SoulSilver), the Lavender Town theme music was recomposed to a happier tone as, per the game's
                    storyline, the Pokémon Tower was demolished and replaced with the Kanto Radio Tower. On YouTube many
                    remixes of the theme have been made. It was re-recorded for the 2017, 2019, and 2020 Pokémon Go
                    Halloween event.
