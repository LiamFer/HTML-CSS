                <p><a class="linkarticle" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">Eurogamer</a> described Lavender Town as a "standout location" in the original Pokémon games, as it is
                    one of the few locations in the franchise that deals with the fact that the "cute and cuddly"
                    Pokémon could actually die. Rani Baker, writing for Grunge, speculated that this "revelation" is why
                    so many were affected by it. Cian Maher of Bloody Disgusting called the setting "infamous" –
                    "uncanny, weird, and deeply unsettling." He praised the reinvented take in Pokémon: Let's Go,
                    Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!. James Troughton of TheGamer called it "one of the darkest areas of
                    the series" while Jessie Coello, stated that it "birthed some of the most disturbing lore tied to
                    the franchise." Patricia Hernandez wrote that "I can’t think of a single thing in Pokémon more
                    unsettling than Lavender Town." Caroline O’Donoghue of The Guardian singled out Lavender Town as an
                    example of the Pokémon series unique, "half-written, euphemistic" style of story-telling.

                    In 2018, a line of merchandise was made about Lavender Town.
