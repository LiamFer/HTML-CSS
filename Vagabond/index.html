                    Do not, under any circumstances,<br>
                    depend on a partial feeling.<br>
                    Think lightly of yourself<br>

                    Never be jealous.<br>
                    Do not regret what you have done.

                Resentment and complaint are<br>
                appropriate neither for<br>
                oneself nor others.<br>
                In all things have no preferences.<br>
                Be indifferent to where you live.<br>
                Do not hold on to possessions<br>
                you no longer need.

                Death is a necessary part of life. <br>

                Donâ€™t fear the inevitable embrace it.
