                    <p>A precipitous slope, a narrow river width, a fast and violent flow. Due to the terrain and the external
                    influence, the state of the water is perfectly decided. And yet, water obeys only itself. Water is only
                    water. Thoroughly water. Absolutely free.</p>

        <p>As the four seasons between Heaven and Earth flow in an endless cycle, so too, must man work his way through
            his own cycle of seasons continuous.</p>
        <p>There is nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to get better, stronger, richer, quicker, or
            smarter. Everything is within. Everything exists. Seek nothing outside of yourself.</p>

        <p>Enjoy the successes of others, especially your enemies. In their accomplishments, they have revealed the way,
            either to achieve it yourself or to defeat them.</p>
        <p>If it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be. There are a lot of other people and tribes to mingle with. Look
            forward, not backward.</p>
        <p>Musashi was a vagabond who lived outside during the years he built his reputation. Where you live doesn't
            matter nearly as much as what you are doing there.</p>
